Part 1: Provide a proof to derive the formulas for the "SELECT AVG(X) FROM D WHERE c" query under "Fixed-size without Replacement" (i.e., row 3 and column 3) in Table 2 of the following paper: http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mozafari/php/data/uploads/approx_chapter.pdf
Note that you do not need to read the whole paper, you can just read Section 4.2 and 4.3 to learn about the definitions and symbols.
